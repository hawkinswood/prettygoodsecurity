# About Pretty Good Security

Welcome to **Pretty Good Security** – your trusted resource for practical, actionable security guidance that doesn't require a PhD in cybersecurity to understand.

## Our Mission

In an increasingly connected world, security shouldn't be an afterthought or something only experts can understand. We believe that everyone deserves access to clear, practical security advice that they can actually implement in their daily lives.

Our mission is to:
- **Demystify cybersecurity** by breaking down complex concepts into understandable guides
- **Provide practical solutions** that real people can implement without extensive technical knowledge
- **Focus on high-impact security measures** that provide the most protection for your effort
- **Stay current** with the evolving threat landscape and emerging security tools

## What You'll Find Here

### Device Security Guides
Comprehensive guides for securing your:
- **iPhone & iOS devices** - Privacy settings, security features, and best practices
- **Mac & macOS systems** - System hardening, built-in security tools, and maintenance
- **Windows computers** - Security configurations, updates, and protection strategies

### Network & Infrastructure Security
Learn how to secure your digital infrastructure:
- **Router security** - Firmware updates, configuration, and network protection
- **Network monitoring** - Understanding your network traffic and identifying threats
- **VPN solutions** - Including detailed Tailscale guides for secure remote access

### Resources & Tools
Curated collections of:
- Security tools and software recommendations
- Reference materials and documentation
- Step-by-step tutorials and walkthroughs

## Our Philosophy

We embrace the principle of **"Pretty Good Security"** – the fundamental understanding that perfect security doesn't exist, and never will. There is no such thing as being completely secure in our connected world.

However, this reality doesn't mean we should give up. Instead, it means we should focus on what's actually achievable: **meaningful protection through practical measures**.

By following simple, proven best practices, you can significantly improve your security posture for:
- **Your internet-connected devices** - phones, computers, tablets, smart home devices
- **Your online accounts** - email, social media, banking, shopping, and other services
- **Your digital life** - files, photos, communications, and personal information

Our approach recognizes that:
- **Perfect security is impossible** - but meaningful protection is absolutely achievable
- **Simple beats complex** - basic security measures properly implemented are more effective than sophisticated solutions that never get used
- **Consistency matters more than perfection** - regular good habits provide better protection than sporadic perfect practices
- **Risk reduction is the goal** - we can't eliminate all threats, but we can dramatically reduce your exposure to the most common ones

## The Weakest Link

Your security is only as strong as its weakest link – and in most cases, **that weakest link is your email account**.

Here's why: nearly every digital service you use is connected to your email address. Your banking, social media, shopping, cloud storage, work accounts – they all rely on your email for password resets, security notifications, and account recovery. If someone gains access to your email, they can potentially access everything else.

### The SMS Problem

Many people think they're secure because they have "two-factor authentication" enabled, but **SMS text messages are not secure**. Your phone number can be compromised through:

- **SIM swapping** - attackers convince your carrier to transfer your number to their device
- **SS7 attacks** - exploiting vulnerabilities in the cellular network infrastructure  
- **Social engineering** - tricking carrier employees into making account changes
- **Physical theft** - stealing your phone to receive SMS codes

When your phone number is compromised, every account that uses SMS for "security" becomes vulnerable.

### Strengthening the Chain

The solution is simple: **you must strengthen the weakest link until there is no weakness**. This means securing your email account with the strongest possible authentication:

#### Minimum Standard: Authenticator Apps
Replace SMS with an authenticator app like:
- **Authy** - syncs across devices with encryption
- **Google Authenticator** - simple and widely supported
- **Microsoft Authenticator** - integrates well with Microsoft services
- **1Password** - if you're already using their password manager

#### Better: Hardware Security Keys
Physical security keys provide the strongest protection:
- **YubiKey** - the gold standard for hardware keys
- **Google Titan Security Key** - Google's hardware solution
- **SoloKeys** - open-source alternative

#### Best: Passkeys (When Available)
Passkeys represent the future of authentication, but remember:
- **They're only as secure as the device storing them**
- **Device compromise means passkey compromise**
- **Backup and recovery plans are crucial**
- **Not all services support them yet**

### The Domino Effect

Once you've secured your email with strong authentication, extend the same protection to other critical accounts:
- **Password manager** - protects all your other passwords
- **Banking and financial services** - obvious high-value targets
- **Cloud storage** - contains your personal files and photos
- **Work accounts** - protects professional data and access

Remember: security is a chain. Find your weakest link, strengthen it, then find the next weakest link. Repeat until your entire digital life has a consistent level of protection.
