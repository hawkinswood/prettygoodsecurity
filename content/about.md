# About Pretty Good Security

Welcome to **Pretty Good Security** – your trusted resource for practical, actionable security guidance that doesn't require a PhD in cybersecurity to understand.

## Our Philosophy

We follow the principle of **"Pretty Good Security"** – the idea that implementing solid, foundational security measures is far better than perfectionist approaches that never get implemented. 

Perfect security is the enemy of good security. We focus on:
- **Practical over perfect** - Solutions you'll actually use
- **Incremental improvement** - Small steps that compound over time
- **Risk-based thinking** - Focusing effort where it matters most
- **Accessibility** - Making security approachable for everyone
