## Introduction

Tailscale is a zero-configuration mesh VPN service that connects your devices in a secure peer-to-peer network (a tailnet) using the WireGuard® protocol. It is designed to be easy to set up and works with your existing single sign-on identity (like your Google, Microsoft, or GitHub account) for authentication. All data between your devices is end-to-end encrypted using device keys; the Tailscale coordination servers never see your private traffic.

### Key Benefits

* **Cross-Platform Support**: Native clients for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, allowing all your devices to join the same private network.

* **Easy Installation & Login**: Simple installation and login using existing accounts – no new passwords to manage.

* **Auto Peer Discovery**: Devices find each other via a coordination server and connect directly when possible (or via relays if needed), with no manual IP configuration.

* **Tailnet (Private Network)**: Your devices form a tailnet that is isolated from other users – only devices you authorize can join. By default, devices in your tailnet can reach each other freely.

* **Identity-Based Access**: Tailscale uses your identity to manage access. You can enforce multi-factor auth via your identity provider and define fine-grained ACL rules based on users and device tags rather than IPs.

* **No Port Forwarding Needed**: Services on your devices (e.g. RDP, SSH, web servers, NAS, etc.) become accessible through Tailscale IP addresses or domain names without exposing ports to the internet.

* **Solid Security Model**: Built on proven WireGuard encryption, with keys stored only on your devices. Tailscale's servers only coordinate initial setup and key exchange, and even if a Tailscale relay (DERP) is used, it relays only encrypted packets.

* **Transparent and Open-Source Elements**: The core Tailscale code (client, daemon, relay) is largely open source, and security practices are openly documented.

This guide will walk you through using Tailscale for personal/home purposes. We cover installation on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS), initial setup of your personal tailnet, and key features like managing devices and keys, configuring access controls, using subnet routers and exit nodes, MagicDNS, device sharing, Tailscale SSH, and more. We'll also discuss typical use cases (like remote access to your home network) and provide tips on privacy, security, and troubleshooting.

## Creating an Account and Your Tailnet

Before installing Tailscale, you should create a Tailscale account (which also creates your personal tailnet). A tailnet is Tailscale's term for your private network of devices. When using Tailscale for personal use, your tailnet is typically associated with your personal email identity.

### Account Setup Steps

1. **Sign Up with an Identity Provider**: Visit the Tailscale website and click Get Started. Tailscale uses third-party login (OAuth) – on the signup page, choose an identity provider you already use (such as Google, Microsoft, GitHub, or Apple) and authenticate. No separate Tailscale-specific password is needed. This login will become the administrator of your tailnet.

2. **Personal vs. Domain Accounts**: If you sign up with a personal email (public domain) like Gmail, Yahoo, etc., Tailscale will automatically place you on the Personal plan (free for up to 3 user accounts). This plan is ideal for home users and includes nearly all features. If instead you sign up with a custom domain email, Tailscale assumes a business and starts an Enterprise trial. For purely personal use, it's recommended to use a public-domain email to stay on the free Personal plan.

3. **Tailnet Initialization**: After signup, Tailscale will ask whether the network is for Business or Personal use. Choose Personal use. This mainly influences defaults and plan selection. Once done, your tailnet is created, identified by your login.

4. **First Device Registration**: The web onboarding may prompt you to add your first device. You can either follow the prompts to download Tailscale on your current device or manually install the client. When you log in from the Tailscale app on a device, it registers to your tailnet under your account. As soon as it's authenticated, you'll see the device appear in your Tailscale admin console.

5. **Adding More Devices**: To add a second or subsequent device, simply install Tailscale on that device and log in with the same account. You can also use the admin console's "Add device" flow: it provides a link or QR code to simplify enrolling a new device.

Once you have at least one device connected, your tailnet is active. By default, Tailscale's policy is wide open for a single-user tailnet – any device you add can reach any other device on any port. Later in this guide, we'll show how to use ACLs to impose restrictions if needed.

## Installing Tailscale on Different Platforms

Tailscale provides client applications for all major operating systems. The functionality is very similar across platforms – once installed, the client will run in the background to keep your device connected to the tailnet, and provide a user interface for status and settings.

### Windows Installation

Tailscale supports Windows 10 and later. The Windows client is distributed as an easy installer (.exe or .msi). To install on Windows:

1. **Download the Installer**: Go to the official Tailscale Download page and click Windows, or directly download the latest installer from Tailscale's site. The same installer works for both 64-bit and 32-bit systems and will auto-select the appropriate version.

2. **Run the Installer**: Launch the .exe installer you downloaded and follow any prompts. Installation is quick. Once done, a Tailscale icon (a small blue/white octagonal logo) will appear in your system tray.

3. **Log In to Tailscale**: Click the new Tailscale tray icon and choose "Log in". This will open your web browser to the Tailscale authentication page. Log in using the same identity/provider you used to create your account.

4. **Verify Connection**: The Tailscale tray app will update to show you as connected. In the tray menu, under your account name, you should see status messages (like Connected and your device's Tailscale IP). At this point, your Windows machine is part of the tailnet.

That's it – Tailscale will automatically start with Windows on boot. You can click the tray icon anytime to see status, disconnect/reconnect, or access settings. If you ever need to uninstall, Tailscale provides an Uninstall option in Add/Remove Programs.

### macOS Installation

The Tailscale macOS client supports macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later. There are multiple ways to install it:

#### Installation Methods

1. **Direct Download (Recommended)**
   - Download the `.pkg` installer directly from Tailscale's package server
   - This version tends to receive updates fastest
   - Run the installer to place Tailscale in Applications

2. **Mac App Store**
   - Available free on the Mac App Store
   - Requires an Apple ID (with payment method configured, even though the app is free)
   - Updates come through the App Store

3. **Advanced Methods**
   - Build from source or use Homebrew (generally not needed for most users)
   - Tailscale's core is open source

#### Setup Steps

1. **Install the App**: Use one of the above methods to install Tailscale in your Applications.

2. **Onboarding and VPN Permission**: 
   - Launch Tailscale for the first time
   - Follow prompts to enable the network extension (VPN profile)

3. **Log In**:
   - Click "Log in" or "Sign in"
   - Your browser will open to the Tailscale login page
   - Sign in with your chosen identity provider

4. **Verify Connection**:
   - The Tailscale menubar icon should become solid
   - Click it to see your connection status and Tailscale IP
   - You can also view a list of your other devices

Tailscale on macOS will start on login by default. For most personal users, the normal app installation is the simplest option.

### Linux Installation

Tailscale works on a wide variety of Linux distributions. Here are the main installation methods:

#### One-Line Installer (Quickest Method)

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

This script:
- Detects your distribution
- Configures the appropriate package repository
- Downloads and installs Tailscale
- May prompt for sudo password

#### Package Manager Installation

Alternatively, you can use your distribution's package manager:
- Available for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, AlmaLinux, Arch, NixOS, Raspberry Pi OS, etc.
- Distribution-specific instructions are available in Tailscale's documentation
- Recommended if you prefer not to use the curl installer

#### Post-Installation Setup

1. **Start the Service**:
   - The installer usually starts the tailscaled daemon automatically
   - If not, run `sudo tailscaled &` and enable it in systemd

2. **Authentication**:
   - Run `tailscale up` in the terminal
   - Follow the provided URL for authentication
   - For headless systems (servers, Raspberry Pi), you can open the URL on another device

3. **Verify Connection**:
   - Run `tailscale status` to see your connection
   - You should see your Tailscale IP (100.x.y.z)
   - The command will also list other devices in your tailnet

### Android Installation

The Tailscale Android app works on Android 8.0 (Oreo) or newer, supporting phones, tablets, and Android/Google TV devices.

#### Installation Steps

1. **Install the App**:
   - Open Google Play Store and search for "Tailscale"

3. **Authentication**:
   - Tap "Log in" in the app
   - Use the in-app browser for Tailscale login
   - Sign in with your identity provider (Google/Apple ID/GitHub, etc.)

## Managing Devices and Keys

Once your devices are connected to your tailnet, you can manage their settings and credentials through the web admin console or CLI. Here are the key aspects of device management:

### Device Names and Rename

- Devices are automatically named based on their system hostname
- Names are visible in the admin console's Machines list
- Used for MagicDNS (automatic internal DNS)
- You can rename devices to more friendly names (e.g., "Gaming-PC" instead of "DESKTOP-ABCD")
- Rename via admin console: Machines page -> click device -> Edit name
- Updated names propagate to all devices and MagicDNS

### Device Authorization

- More relevant for multi-user tailnets
- Can require admin approval for new devices
- Enable via admin console settings
- New devices from non-admins will be in pending state
- Not necessary for single-user environments

### Device Keys and Security

#### Key Expiry
- Each device gets a WireGuard key pair on login
- Keys expire after 180 days by default
- Notifications sent before expiry
- Re-authenticate to renew for another period
- Can modify expiry period or disable it per device
- Consider security implications of disabling expiry

#### Revoking Access
- Remove devices via admin console if lost/stolen
- Immediate invalidation of keys
- Device loses connection instantly
- Must re-authenticate if device returns
- Appears as unregistered until re-authenticated

### Auth Keys (Pre-authorization)

Auth keys are useful for:
- Headless devices
- Automated deployments
- Avoiding interactive login

Key Features:
1. **Types**:
   - One-off (single use)
   - Reusable (multiple devices)
   - One-off recommended for personal use

2. **Usage**:
   - Generate in admin console (Keys section)
   - Use with `tailscale up --authkey <key>`
   - Can assign tags for device roles

3. **Expiry**:
   - Set expiry when generating
   - Expired unused keys can't add devices
   - Added devices keep their node key expiry

### Tagged Devices

- Advanced feature for role-based access
- Assign roles like `role=nas`
- Use in ACLs for specific permissions
- Tagged devices don't expire keys by default
- Mainly used in enterprise/server setups

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

ACLs help you define fine-grained access policies within your tailnet. By default, all devices in a single-user tailnet can communicate freely, but you can restrict this if needed.

### Key Concepts

1. **Default Policy**
   - "Deny-by-default" model
   - New tailnets allow all connections initially
   - Customizable via policy file

2. **Policy Types**
   - Traditional ACL rules
   - Grant rules (advanced feature)
   - Both can coexist in policy file

3. **How ACLs Work**
   - Define allowed sources, destinations, ports
   - If no rule matches, connection is blocked
   - Can isolate devices or limit access

### Common Use Cases

1. **Device Isolation**
   - Separate work and personal devices
   - Isolate IoT devices
   - Limit guest access

2. **Service Restrictions**
   - Control access to specific ports
   - Limit access to sensitive services
   - Enforce user-based permissions

Example: To isolate a work laptop from accessing a personal NAS:
```json
{
  "ACLs": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "users": ["*"],
      "ports": ["*:*"],
      "except": {
        "users": ["work-laptop"],
        "ports": ["nas:445"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The ACL system is powerful and flexible, allowing you to create precise access rules based on:
- Device IPs
- Device tags
- User identities
- Port ranges
- Service types

For most home users, the default open policy is sufficient. Consider implementing ACLs if you:
- Share your tailnet with family members
- Need to isolate certain devices
- Want to restrict access to sensitive services

## Subnet Routers and Exit Nodes

Tailscale can do more than just connect its clients - it can route traffic for entire networks. This section covers two powerful features:
- Subnet Routers: Access an entire network via Tailscale
- Exit Nodes: Route internet traffic through a Tailscale node

### Subnet Routers

A Subnet Router allows devices on your tailnet to reach IP addresses on a private network that isn't running Tailscale directly. This is particularly useful for accessing home LAN devices (printers, IoT gadgets, etc.) when you're away.

#### Example Use Case
If your home Wi-Fi network is `192.168.1.0/24`, a subnet router can advertise this range on Tailscale, allowing any of your Tailscale devices to access `192.168.1.x` addresses through the tunnel.

#### Setup Process

1. **Choose a Router Device**
   - Common choices:
     - Raspberry Pi
     - Spare always-on PC
     - NAS with Tailscale support
   - Device must be connected to target network
   - Linux is recommended for stability

2. **Enable IP Forwarding**
   - Required for packet forwarding between Tailscale and local network
   - On Linux:
     ```bash
     # Set in /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf
     net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
     ```
   - Adjust firewall rules to allow forwarding
   - Windows and macOS are possible but not recommended

3. **Advertise Routes**
   ```bash
   tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   - Can specify multiple subnets (comma-separated)
   - GUI may have "Offer route" option
   - Verify with `tailscale status`

4. **Authorize Routes**
   - Go to Admin Console -> Machines
   - Find device with "Subnet routes: 192.168.1.0/24 (disabled)"
   - Enable/approve the route
   - Security measure against compromised devices

5. **Configure ACLs**
   - If using restrictive ACLs, update to allow subnet access
   - Example ACL entry:
     ```json
     {
       "Action": "accept",
       "Src": ["*"],
       "Dst": ["192.168.1.0/24:*"]
     }
     ```

#### Usage

- Other Tailscale clients automatically route subnet traffic
- No special configuration needed on clients
- Mobile apps may prompt to accept subnet routes
- Access subnet IPs directly (e.g., printer at 192.168.1.100)

#### Troubleshooting

1. **Connectivity Issues**
   - Check firewall settings on subnet router
   - Verify destination device's firewall
   - Ensure proper gateway configuration

2. **Return Traffic**
   - Tailscale uses automatic masquerading (NAT)
   - Source IPs appear from subnet router's LAN IP
   - Ensures proper response routing

#### Advanced Features

- Multiple networks per router
- Multiple routers per subnet (redundancy)
- BGP support for advanced setups
- Shared nodes cannot advertise subnets

### Exit Nodes

An Exit Node is a Tailscale device that can route all your internet traffic, similar to a traditional VPN's "full tunnel" mode. Unlike commercial VPNs, Tailscale doesn't provide exit nodes - you use your own devices as exit points.

#### Common Use Cases

- Route traffic through your home network when on public Wi-Fi
- Access region-specific content from your home IP
- Bypass network restrictions while maintaining privacy
- Appear to be browsing from your home network

#### Setting Up an Exit Node

1. **Choose a Device**
   - Need reliable internet connection
   - Sufficient bandwidth
   - Unrestricted internet access
   - Common choices:
     - Home server
     - Always-on PC
     - VPS you control

2. **Enable Exit Node Mode**
   - Via Command Line:
     ```bash
     tailscale up --advertise-exit-node
     ```
   - Via GUI:
     - Check "Use this device as an exit node"
   - Mobile:
     - Toggle "Run as exit node" in settings

3. **Approve in Admin Console**
   - Go to Machines list
   - Enable "Use as exit node"
   - Requires admin privileges
   - Auto-approves for admins

4. **Using an Exit Node**
   - In Tailscale app UI:
     - Find "Exit Node" option
     - Select configured device
   - Via Command Line:
     ```bash
     tailscale up --exit-node=<name or IP>
     ```
   - Optional LAN Access:
     ```bash
     tailscale up --exit-node-allow-lan-access=true
     ```

#### Privacy and Security

- Traffic encrypted between client and exit node
- Tailscale doesn't log traffic
- Exit node sees decrypted traffic
- Trust model: You own the exit node
- Bandwidth uses exit node's data plan

#### Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Check if exit node is online
   - Verify DNS resolution
   - Look for relay indicators
   - Consider switching exit nodes

2. **Performance**
   - Check for DERP relay usage
   - Monitor bandwidth capacity
   - Consider geographic proximity

## DNS and MagicDNS

Tailscale assigns each device a unique IP in the `100.64.0.0/10` range. MagicDNS makes these addresses more user-friendly by providing automatic DNS resolution.

### MagicDNS Features

1. **Automatic Naming**
   - Format: `devicename.tailnet-name.ts.net`
   - Example: `raspberrypi.smith-family.ts.net`
   - Short names work within tailnet
   - No need for full domain name

2. **Default Settings**
   - Enabled by default on new tailnets
   - Easy to enable in admin console
   - No external DNS server needed
   - Works with Tailscale v1.20+

3. **Usage Examples**
   ```bash
   ssh user@laptop
   http://raspberrypi:3000
   ping nas
   ```

## Sharing Devices and Files

Tailscale allows you to share access with other people in controlled ways through Device Sharing and Taildrop features.

### Device Sharing (Node Sharing)

Device Sharing lets you grant someone outside your tailnet access to a specific device without adding them as a full network member. Perfect for one-off collaborations like:
- Sharing a game server with friends
- Giving family members access to a specific service
- Temporary collaboration on a project

#### How It Works

1. **Initiating a Share**
   - Go to Admin Console -> Machines
   - Select device to share
   - Choose "Share" option
   - Options:
     - Send email invites (unique links)
     - Generate share link (single-use or reusable)

2. **Recipient Process**
   - Click received link
   - Log in to Tailscale (or sign up)
   - Must be Owner/Admin of their tailnet
   - Device appears in their list as shared

3. **Access Details**
   - Recipient can use device's:
     - Tailscale IP
     - MagicDNS name
   - Only shared device is visible
   - Connection is one-to-one

#### Security Features

1. **Quarantine Mode**
   - Enabled by default
   - Device only responds to incoming connections
   - No outbound connections initiated
   - Prevents malware spread

2. **MagicDNS Integration**
   - Works across tailnets
   - Use full domain name:
     - `device.tailnet.ts.net`
   - IP addresses always work

3. **Access Control**
   - Governed by both tailnets' ACLs:
     - Your ACLs control inbound
     - Recipient's ACLs control outbound
   - Check service accessibility

#### Management

1. **Monitoring Shares**
   - View in Admin Console
   - See all active shares
   - Track usage and access

2. **Revoking Access**
   - Can revoke anytime
   - Immediate disconnection
   - Device removed from recipient's list

### Taildrop (File Sharing)
