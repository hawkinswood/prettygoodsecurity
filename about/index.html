We believe that everyone deserves access to clear, practical security advice that they can actually implement in their daily lives.\nOur mission is to:\nDemystify cybersecurity by breaking down complex concepts into understandable guides Provide practical solutions that real people can implement without extensive technical knowledge Focus on high-impact security measures that provide the most protection for your effort Stay current with the evolving threat landscape and emerging security tools What You’ll Find Here Comprehensive Security Guides The Weakest Link: Our foundational guide explaining how your digital security operates as an interconnected system. Learn why email accounts require special attention, understand authentication method trade-offs, and discover practical steps to strengthen your security chain.\nDevice Security Guides: Platform-specific security guidance for:\niPhone \u0026 iOS devices - Privacy settings, security features, and best practices Mac \u0026 macOS systems - System hardening, built-in security tools, and maintenance Windows computers - Security configurations, updates, and protection strategies Network \u0026 Infrastructure Security: Essential knowledge for protecting your digital infrastructure:\nRouter security - Comprehensive guidance on firmware management, configuration, and network protection Network monitoring - Understanding your network traffic and identifying threats Tailscale guides - Detailed tutorials for secure remote access and networking Resources \u0026 Tools: Curated collections of security tools, reference materials, and step-by-step tutorials.\nOur Philosophy We embrace the principle of “Pretty Good Security” – the understanding that perfect security doesn’t exist and never will. However, this reality doesn’t mean we should give up. Instead, it means we should focus on what’s actually achievable: meaningful protection through practical measures.\nKey Principles Security is a Chain: Your digital security operates as an interconnected system where the protection of one account often depends on the security of others. Understanding these relationships helps you prioritize your security efforts effectively.\nFocus on the Weakest Link: In most cases, your email account serves as the weakest link because nearly every digital service uses email for password resets, security alerts, and account recovery. Securing your email with strong authentication is the foundation of good security.\nSimple Beats Complex: Basic security measures properly implemented are more effective than sophisticated solutions that never get used. We prioritize practical steps you’ll actually follow.\nConsistency Matters: Regular good habits provide better protection than sporadic perfect practices. Small, consistent improvements build strong security over time.\nRisk Reduction is the Goal: We can’t eliminate all threats, but we can dramatically reduce your exposure to the most common ones.\nUnderstanding Digital Security Why Email Security is Critical Your email account often serves as a gateway to other services because most digital platforms use email for:\nPassword reset requests Security alerts and notifications Account verification and recovery Two-factor authentication backup methods When an attacker gains access to your email account, they can potentially request password resets for linked accounts, receive reset communications directly, and access sensitive information across multiple services.\nThe Authentication Hierarchy Not all authentication methods provide equal security:\nSMS Text Messages: While better than passwords alone, SMS has documented vulnerabilities including SIM swapping, network-level interception, and social engineering attacks against carriers.\nAuthenticator Apps: Generate codes locally on your device, work offline, and aren’t tied to phone numbers. Examples include Authy, Google Authenticator, and Microsoft Authenticator.\nHardware Security Keys: Provide maximum security independence with private keys that never leave the device. Examples include YubiKey, Google Titan, and SoloKeys.\nPasskeys: Offer excellent security with superior usability but depend on platform security infrastructure from providers like Apple or Google.\nPractical Implementation Strategy Week 1: Secure your email and password manager with strong two-factor authentication Week 2: Apply enhanced security to financial and work accounts Week 3: Review and secure cloud storage and important personal accounts\nWeek 4: Implement monitoring systems and test recovery procedures\nNetwork Security Fundamentals Your home router represents a critical component in your security chain. Unlike other devices that handle personal data, your router controls ALL network traffic, making it a strategic target for attackers.\nCommon Router Vulnerabilities Consumer routers often suffer from systemic security problems:\nFirmware contains outdated software components with known vulnerabilities Manufacturers provide minimal ongoing security support Updates are infrequent and often abandon older models entirely Default configurations prioritize features over security Essential Router Security Change Default Credentials: Replace default administrator passwords with strong, unique credentials.\nDisable Unnecessary Features: Turn off WPS, UPnP, remote administration, and other services that increase security risks.\nUpdate Firmware Regularly: Check for and install updates monthly. Consider router replacement if no updates have been available for over two years.\nUse Strong WiFi Security: Configure networks to use WPA3 (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn’t available) with strong passwords.\nAbout the Author Hawkins Wood brings years of experience in cybersecurity, system administration, and privacy advocacy. With a background in both technical implementation and security education, Hawkins focuses on translating complex security concepts into actionable guidance that anyone can follow.\nGetting Started If you’re new to security planning, start with The Weakest Link guide to understand how your digital security operates as an interconnected system. Then explore our device-specific guides and network security resources based on your particular needs and interests.\nRemember: security is a journey, not a destination. Start with the basics, implement what you can, and gradually build your security posture over time. Every step forward makes you more secure than you were yesterday.\nStay Connected RSS Feed - Subscribe to stay updated with the latest guides and security news Search - Use our built-in search to quickly find specific topics Categories \u0026 Tags - Browse content by device type, security domain, or topic Last updated: May 28, 2025\n","wordCount":"965","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://hawkinswood.github.io/prettygoodsecurity/images/logo.png","datePublished":"2025-05-28T12:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-05-28T12:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hawkins Wood"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://hawkinswood.github.io/prettygoodsecurity/about/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Pretty Good Security","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://hawkinswood.github.io/prettygoodsecurity/images/favicon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://hawkinswood.github.io/prettygoodsecurity/ accesskey=h title="Pretty Good Security (Alt + H)">Pretty Good Security</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
